## Description

This is a repository where I will be keeping all my notes on React.
Each folder has materials and note for each lesson I am following. I plan to use all
this knowledge learned from React to first make a React Implementation of the game 2048.
Then I will have enough knowledge, so I will redo my Mango-Bytes project.
